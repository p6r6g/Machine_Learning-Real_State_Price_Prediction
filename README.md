# Machine Learning - Real State Price Prediction
Predicting real state housing prices using Machine Learning on Kaggle dataset using ML models (Decision Tree & Random Forest)

Using these foundational machine learning steps :

- Data Cleaning & Exploration for modeling using Pandas.

- Decision Trees: building and optimizing decision trees for both classification and regression tasks using Scikit Learn.

- Splitting the dataset into training data and testing data for model fitting.

- Overfitting & Underfitting: Finding the sweet spot to minimize model error & maximize prediction accuracy.

- Random Forest: Using a more sophisticated algorithm than decision trees to further improve model accuracy.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) & Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
